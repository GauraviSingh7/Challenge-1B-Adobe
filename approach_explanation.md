# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence Approach

## Overview
This solution uses Ollama (llama3.2:1b model) to provide intelligent, context-aware document analysis completely offline. The system extracts relevant sections from multiple PDFs based on specific personas and their job requirements.

## Architecture

### 1. PDF Processing Pipeline
- **Document Parsing**: Extends Challenge 1A outline extraction to include full content
- **Section Detection**: Uses heuristic-based heading detection (numbered, capitalized, title-case patterns)
- **Content Extraction**: Maintains page-level mapping and hierarchical structure

### 2. Ollama-Based Intelligence
- **Model**: llama3.2:1b (~1GB) for optimal size/performance balance
- **Offline Operation**: Model downloaded during Docker build, no runtime internet access
- **Context-Aware Prompting**: Tailored prompts based on persona role and job requirements

### 3. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
- **Semantic Analysis**: Ollama evaluates section relevance using natural language understanding
- **Persona Matching**: Considers user role, expertise level, and specific task requirements  
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combines content quality, task alignment, and role relevance
- **Ranking System**: 1-10 scale with structured prompt engineering for consistency

### 4. Subsection Analysis
- **Key Insight Extraction**: Ollama generates actionable takeaways from top-ranked sections
- **Role-Specific Focus**: Adapts analysis style based on persona (researcher vs. student vs. analyst)
- **Concise Output**: Provides 2-3 focused insights per section for practical use

## Technical Implementation

### Offline Compliance
- All models pre-downloaded during Docker build
- No external API calls or internet dependencies
- Local Ollama service for all LLM operations
- Self-contained processing pipeline

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel document processing where possible
- Content filtering to skip very short sections
- Optimized prompts to reduce token usage
- Efficient PDF parsing with content caching

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if Ollama service issues
- Robust PDF parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Input validation and comprehensive logging
- Service readiness checks with retry logic

## Output Quality
The system produces structured JSON output with ranked sections based on persona-job relevance, detailed metadata about processing, refined subsection analysis with actionable insights, and page-level traceability for all extracted content.

This approach leverages modern LLM capabilities while maintaining strict offline requirements and performance constraints.
